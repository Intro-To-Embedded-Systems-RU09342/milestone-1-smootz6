This project involved creating a node in an individually addressable RGB LED strip.
The node consisted of an MSP430G2553 on a development board with an RGB LED
attached to it. The node performed communications with previous and subsequent
nodes over a custom UART protocol. The brightness and color of the RGB LED was
controlled by PWM outputs from the MSP430.
